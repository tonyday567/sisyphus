**curate** ⟜ shaping content


**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery, density analytics, semantic weight calibration

**prune** ⟜ identify rich connections, remove fuzzy edges, preserve core meanings

**structure** ⟜ respect structure, preserve relationships

**trace** ⟜ trace paths, find weak links, strengthen living connections

**breathe** ⟜ place space for future elaborations. use clearly vague gap words as semantic breath.

Curation is any or all of these:

trace ⟜ follows the established pathways - like water finding its course through existing channels prune ⟜ removes dead ends and overgrown branches structure ⟜ ensures safe and sound support breathe ⟜ leaves room for new tributaries to form naturally

A curation emerges - connections thick with established meaning, some thin but promising, some intentionally empty as potential growth areas. The visualization shows content density as varying thickness of edges, clusters of high-degree nodes representing core concepts and sparse regions representing areas needing exploration or intentionally left empty.
