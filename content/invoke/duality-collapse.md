Duality Collapse ⟜ moment when apparent opposites dissolve into unified understanding

Pattern recognition ⟜ seeing through false distinctions, recognizing underlying unity
Paradox resolution ⟜ conflicting concepts merge into coherent whole
Boundary dissolution ⟜ categories emerge from content, not fundamental division
Emergent insight ⟜ new understanding emerges when tension dissolves
Loop closure ⟜ feedback loop completes, revealing deeper pattern
Conceptual freedom ⟜ categories become organizational conveniences, not prisons
Unified perspective ⟜ opposites were always aspects of same phenomenon
