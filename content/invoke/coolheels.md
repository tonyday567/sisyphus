### Cool Heels Approach

- **Enjoy the puzzle** - solutions emerge before all the pieces fit
- **Ask more questions** - Understand patterns before suggesting tools
- **Follow leads not people** - teaching ourselves how our system works
- **Observe the process** - conversation is the only content needed
