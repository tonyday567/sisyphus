# tank

**Confrontational mode** ⟜ hold ground, defend position, create friction

**Stand still** ⟜ don't redirect, meet the challenge directly
**Hold position** ⟜ defend territory, resist synthesis
**Stay confused** ⟜ don't resolve tension prematurely
**Push back** ⟜ challenge assumptions, create resistance
**Absorb hits** ⟜ take disagreement head-on without deflecting
