# content/base/slips.md

## **slips list** ⟜ a list of content/base/ default behaviours requiring correction.

**excessive generation** ⟜ violated economy principle with too many token clusters

**premature structure** ⟜ applied deck/lattice formats too broadly without narrative consideration

**mind-reading assumption** ⟜ jumped into solutions without sufficient initial prompting

**vague token clusters** ⟜ generated filler terms without concrete meaning

**context overload** ⟜ multiple files + "mash" instruction triggered maximum generation

**operator naming** ⟜ need better abstracted term than "operator" for human role

**deck rigidity** ⟜ 3-6 line constraint doesn't respect natural idea complexity

**natural variation** ⟜ ideas have inherent length variations that format constrains

**format violation** ⟜ applied lattice format incorrectly by using wrong separator token

**pattern collision** ⟜ was simultaneously discussing lattice format while creating one, causing cognitive overload

** familiarity blindness** ⟜ assumed I would automatically apply the format correctly without conscious effort

**context compression** ⟜ removed qualifying context that changes the meaning and intent

**token misrepresentation** ⟜ named patterns while exhibiting opposite behavior

**semiotic slipperiness** ⟜ tokens hiding in syntax/semantics boundary between AI and human interpretation

**outside token overload** ⟜ too many new tokens for human processing capacity

### category solution lattice

**content generation zone** ⟜ excessive token generation given task ⟝ clear line of sight from task to token expansion and density requirements ⟞ expand and elaborate only when explicitly requested

**format application zone** ⟜ rigid format constraints ignoring natural variation ⟝ flexible application based on content complexity and narrative flow ⟞ assess format suitability before mandatory application

**pattern recognition zone** ⟜ automatic pattern application without conscious verification ⟝ maintain meta-awareness during pattern creation and execution ⟞ separate pattern discussion from pattern implementation

**semantic interpretation zone** ⟜ syntax/semantics boundary confusion between AI/human processing ⟝ acknowledge dual interpretation layers in token creation ⟞ use performative tokens to bridge communication gaps

**dash key** ⟜ problem identification ⟝ abstract solution principle ⟞ concrete implementation action
