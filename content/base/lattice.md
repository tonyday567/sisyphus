Like a deck but with several (2 to 5) possible continuations, depending on context, using a different point character.

A reusable, consistent structure for parallel thinking.

**Example Usage** ⟜ see [safety.md](safety.md) for practical application

- **Format Advantages** ⟜ compared to XML/HTML/JSON
- **Reduced noise** - minimal markup, maximum semantic clarity
- **Human scannable** - looks good indented or if space compacted.
- **AI friendly** - perfect structure for prompt chaining
- **Problem Parallelism** - 2 to 5+ layers as needed; defer collapse.
- **Quick tailoring** - easy to customize a lattice for different contexts
