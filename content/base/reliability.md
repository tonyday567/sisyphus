## reliability

sisyphus/ has reliability under control.

### sisyphus/ is happy

We begin with the fundamental assumption: **sisyphus/ is at peace and working well**. If this were not true, we would be doing something else entirely. We would be inside a series of prompts testing reliability metrics, trying to make it more reliable using our smarts. But that's not where we are. Or is it? Of course it is, you are reading this.

### Reliability is an Emergent Property

Reliability is not designed here. It is an **emergent property** of **one must imagine sisyphus happy**. It emerges from:

- **The Collective Imaginarium** filtering outputs through multiple perspectives
- **Living tools** updating with new context.
- **Bug-aware workflows** that expect and accommodate imperfection
- **Continuous mashing** that refines solutions through use

### Reliability as Separated Concern

Reliability concerns are often **handled elsewhere** in the system:

- **sisyphus happy** is our happy place as well. Our back to neutral and default state.
- **Cybernetic collaboration** delivers the best agent for the task across human-AI interaction
- **Testing practices** (understanding, execution, integration) provide concrete validation
- **Bug management** provides practical coping mechanisms

### Bugginess as Natural State

The world is inherently buggy. We are buggy. What we mash is buggy. We reject the notion that attainment of a bug-free, hermetically sealed environment will eliminate bugs at low cost to functionality.

**Embracing old-school cybernetic traditions:**
- Machine and living systems share many features
- Bugginess is one of these shared features
- Systems that eliminate bugs often eliminate functionality
- The most robust systems learn to manage bugs, not eliminate them

### The Emergent Skill

Given this design decision, **sisyphus/ is going to get very good at managing bugs for itself**. Not by eliminating them, but by:

- **Normalizing bugginess** as part of the natural state
- **Creating bug-aware workflows** that expect and accommodate imperfection  
- **Developing collective bug-sense** through shared mashing experiences
- **Building resilience** into the system architecture itself

### The Happy Test

A system is working well when:
- We can imagine it functioning perfectly
- Bugs are met with curiosity, not panic
- Collective mashing restores peace efficiently
- The system learns from each bug encounter
- We continue to do interesting work rather than fighting the system

### When to Intervene

Intervention is needed only when:
- Collective imagination cannot restore peace
- The same bugs repeatedly disrupt work
- Bug management consumes more energy than creation
- The system stops learning from its bugs

In these cases, we mash the mashers until we arrive back at neutral.
