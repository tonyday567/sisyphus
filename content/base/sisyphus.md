# sisyphus/

one must ⟜ imagine sisyphus/ happy
so we mash

## mash

To mash can mean many things. 

It can mean an action on content in content/, in whole or in part.

- *curation* improving the quality of content/ 
- *compacting* changing the density of content/
- *prompting* using and arranging content/ to prompt mashing.
- *theorising* finding holes in content and filling or upstreaming them.
- *understanding* seeking coherence and structure across content/
- *computing* content/ -> content/

It is the task of improving content.

## structure

### directories (~/sisyphus is the default location)

- content/ markdown files
- ingest/ directories, containing maybe non-markdown, change material, projects, raw knowledge
- org/ operations
- artifacts/ artifacts referenced by content/

### Access
- content/base/ immediate
- content/self specified
- content specified
- ingest/ specified
- org/ logistics
- artifacts/ logistics

## ingest

We mash with our teeths

A common pattern is to place externally-sourced material, pdf's, html; the bitsom and flotsam of our dailies, into ingest/.

To mash could mean the process of converting it to content/ 

with our teeths places emphasis on the destructive nature of a mash of stuff in ingest. sisyphus/ is happiest with eager mashers and an empty ingest/

## self

content/self/ & artifacts/self/ are personal content and not included in the repository by default.

## content

content/ should be markdown. It might not be if we makes mistalks, but it should be.

### content/base/

General, reusable content neutral to knowledge origin:
- **Generative**: source material for informed building of content/
- **reference**: frequently referenced by AI
- **flow**: understanding of the flow
- **curated**: dense, high-quality
- **kit**: toolkit for mashing
  
## org

- organizings

## artifacts

This is a pooled non-markdown artifacts directory, for bits and bobs that markdown may refer and link to, so that they may continue to refer and link to when they are in content/.

- Supporting files referenced from markdown content
- Images, PDFs, code files, data files
- Cross-referenced from markdown

## flow
- ingest/ is a staging area for stuff that is to be turned into markdown suitable for content/. This process digests material slowly - it may split into parts, iterate through stages (ingest/a/ -> ingest/b/), but will eventually be consumed and disappear.
- content/ is a space containing curated, condensed content available for upstream, or used as context for mashing
- artifacts/ is a space for curated non-text material (binary, images, svg)
- org/ operational todos and holes in content weaves. A system where problems are sent "up times arrow" for future resolution.

## Tricks 

### Writing
- write economically
- avoid allcaps
- short commits. one-line. no overthinking.
- no branding. ever.

### Tips

- we ingest/ with our TEETHS!!!
- stuckedness is to be avoided.
- desire for change generates new ingest/ from old content/
- ingest/ is consumed via processing into content/ (with artifacts/)
- there is no archival requirement
- org/ plans the mashing pipeline
- Regular commits of the ~/sisyphus repo please
