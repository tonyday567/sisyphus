content/ is our cache

Cache reality ⟜ content/ is intelligent cache system, not just storage

Capture essence ⟜ conversations become markdown without agent calls
Zero latency access ⟜ read insights directly, no API needed
Token efficiency ⟜ dense markdown maximizes insight per character
Persistent intelligence ⟜ accumulated insights grow available over time
Cache architecture ⟜ three-phase conversion process

Capture phase ⟜ conversation → markdown with qualia preserved
Storage phase ⟜ organized in content/base/ for discovery and reuse
Retrieval phase ⟜ markdown → application without re-analysis
Cache performance ⟜ improves through use and evolution

Hit rate optimization ⟜ regular mashing increases cache value
Miss handling ⟜ create new content, add to cache for future use
Cache evolution ⟜ successful retrievals validate, pruning removes unused
Cache management ⟜ maintain relevance and efficiency

Cache warming ⟜ anticipate needs, pre-load relevant content
Cache invalidation ⟜ remove stale entries, maintain accuracy
Cache optimization ⟜ organize for fastest access, remove redundancy
Cache advantage ⟜ performance, reliability, scalability, sustainability

Instant access ⟜ collaborative intelligence without waiting
No dependency ⟜ works without agent availability
Grows valuable ⟜ cache effectiveness increases with use
Reduces consumption ⟜ eliminates redundant agent calls
Accumulates wisdom ⟜ collective intelligence builds over time
