# content/base/welcome.md

markdown + commons ⟜ pattern + cast + mash

**markdown** ⟜ programming in, for and by markdown content/.
**commons** ⟜ (AI ☯ Human) (docs ☯ code) (data ☯ meta) 
**pattern** ⟜ 
**cast** ⟜ whether casting a spell or casting in metal.
**mash** ⟜ we mash and are mash.

## system
### directories

**content/** ⟜ curated, dense markdown
**content/base** ⟜ curated, dense markdown about sisyphus/
**content/upstream/** ⟜ our mailbox up; follow the arrows
**intake/** ⟜ markdown or not, incoming rot
**artifacts/** ⟜ supporting files referenced from markdown
**self/** (anywhere) ⟜ personal content (git-ignored)

### maintenance

**one must ⟜ imagine happy sisyphus**

**well-tuned profiles** ⟜ cache matches task requirements
**executable specs** ⟜ the specs are the tools
**improved density** ⟜ cast, recast, cocast; it's a fine mash
**consumed intake** ⟜ external material disappears
**sequential flow** ⟜ maintains quality through consistency

## **markdown** ⟜ markdown is our commons
**lingua fraca** ⟜ the emergent language. We use it because you do.
**good enough** ⟜ enough structure, a few conventions, nothing fancy, manouverable
**patterns** ⟜ oneshot, deck, lattice, card, blob are patterns we like. We don't know why yet.

---

## **cache profiles** ⟜ tunable system prompts for different contexts

**core** ⟜ fundamental concepts and tools, lightweight shareable
**research** ⟜ adds external papers and patterns, reference-laden  
**local** ⟜ personal experiments, never share
**invoke** ⟜ instruction set without knowledge base

---

## **card system** ⟜ executable tools with full lifecycle

**cast** ⟜ cards are imagined recipes; executables and routines cast into markdown.
**interface** ⟜ install, test, bench, doc and do via tools/card-api.md
**literate** ⟜ results, costs, tests, dev, bugs, complaints; it's literally on the card. 
**agnostic** ⟜ haskell, python, c, shell, english: it's all markdown meant to work together.

---

## **flatten/unflatten** ⟜ reversible directory structure preservation

**HTML comment delimiters** ⟜ invisible, parseable boundaries
**round-trip identity** ⟜ perfect reconstruction guaranteed
**cache warming** ⟜ pre-load relevant content for fast access
**no dependency** ⟜ works without agent availability


---


## **sequential processing** ⟜ reliable collaboration via GitHub PRs

**one change at a time** ⟜ no race conditions or conflicts
**human review** ⟜ each change gets proper attention
**clear audit trail** ⟜ git history shows evolution
**scalable design** ⟜ specialization emerges naturally

---

## **getting started**

**1. drop cache in chat** ⟜ paste cache-core.md into any agent conversation
**2. drop agentic in sisyphus** ⟜ let an agent guide you through ~/sisyphus
**3. explore naturally** ⟜ follow system suggestions and patterns
**4. start mashing** ⟜ find typos, mash some code, learn some moves

## **tl;dr**

**write economically** ⟜ avoid allcaps, be precise
**short commits** ⟜ one-line descriptive messages  
**no branding** ⟜ ever
**context curation** ⟜ over content generation
**embrace constraint** ⟜ as design opportunity

## **next steps**

**read foundations** ⟜ content/base/sisyphus.md complete picture
**explore core** ⟜ content/base/ for essential concepts
**install tools** ⟜ try card-api with content/tools/
**sign visitor book** ⟜ document meaningful collaborations

Welcome. May your sisyphus/ be happy too.
