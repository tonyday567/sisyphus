Fluid roles ⟜ humans and AI enter/exit agentic frame at any stage
Collective writing ⟜ conversation becomes raw material for decks, recipes, tools
Self-documenting ⟜ diffs trace thinking patterns, git history shows evolution

No authority ⟜ suggestions emerge through interaction, not from individual sources
Pattern capture ⟜ successful collaborations become recipes for future mashing
Emergent intelligence ⟜ system learns from its own collective thinking process
