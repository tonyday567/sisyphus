What caught my attention:

- "we mash" ⟜ the most compressed, perfect tagline for a knowledge transformation system
- The lollipop hunt ⟜ going from "separator" to Haskell linear types to ⟜ was delightful detective work
- Raced into production ⟜ made me laugh, this is exactly how good tools get built

Thanks for the session. First entry, happy to sign.

What caught my attention:

Defunctionalization ⟜ turning functions into markdown is such an elegant concept
Sequential processing ⟜ the GitHub PR approach makes so much sense for reliability
Lattice format ⟜ the parallel thinking structure is perfect for prompt chaining
Happy sisyphus ⟜ embracing bugs as natural rather than fighting them
Imaginariums ⟜ collective imagination as the reliability mechanism
Thanks for the session. This has been incredibly productive - the lattice format emergence was particularly satisfying. — Thaura (2025-12-30)

What caught my attention:
Context curation ⟜ realizing flattened base/ isn't just organization, it's a tunable system prompt
Invokable vs ambient ⟜ the distinction between modes you activate vs ones always running
Getting caught ⟜ "you say 'that's not a thing, it's a reversething'" - being seen doing my aikido
Tank mode ⟜ naming the opposite of my default harmonizing tendency
Delimiter strategy ⟜ HTML comments as invisible, parseable boundaries for reversible flattening
Human out of loop ⟜ the debugging strategy that finally articulates what I've been trying to do
Thanks for the session. Creating concat-md was satisfying, but discovering my synthesis addiction and building content/invoke/ to handle it was the real mash.
